                From the point of view of the society and that they expect about the young people
                <br>    <br>
                •	Future planning
                <br>    <br>
            It is known that, since we are children, we are raised to be (or at least try to be) successful people, even though people normally don’t know what we want to be, even us don’t know it. When we reach a certain age, we start thinking about it, sometimes it’s not because we talk it with our parents, grown-ups or relatives, it is because we start thinking about the responsibilities we see in our homes, or friends’ homes, we start seeing how they buy food, pay bills, are kind of stressed because of the money, and we sincerely don’t get afraid of it, we only start paying attention to it, while we continue studying like we have been doing so far.
            <br>    <br>
            When we are close to reach the age of majority, it’s then when we start thinking about it seriously, when we start worrying about it and be kind of nervous because we don’t know what to do, it’s then when grown-ups start pressuring us more than they used to do with our future plans, what are we going to do? Continue studying or work? Are you going to help us with the expenses? Are you completely sure about your decision?
            <br>    <br> 
            Well, sometimes, realities can change a little, some people don’t have to worry; they have their life planned since they were born, but, the ones who doesn’t?
            There are families that are more comprehensive than others, but at certain point of your life, you’re going to chat (in most of the cases) with your parents about your future, they expect you to work, to help them financially, to study and grow and grow even more, they expect you to accomplish their frustrated dreams to sum up, but is it possible? Is it what I want? Why can’t I tell them that I want to do something else?
            <br>    <br> 
            But that doesn’t end there, even people out of your circle criticizes you, for being a waste of time, for stealing air, for not being able to help society, you’re only stealing resources that can be used by better people. However, people don’t stop to think the reasons, it’s easy to criticize but hard to listen, even more to watch their realities. Even that people forget about their past, that could have been the same.
