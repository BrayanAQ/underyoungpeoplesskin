            Sometimes we think we are alone facing these empty feelings, and feeling alone makes the thoughts worse.
            Our parents say that we trust them enough to talk about this with them, but we know that despite loving them very much, we do not dare to talk to them about this serious subject because at a certain point we are afraid of disappointing them with our thinking or fear of scolding that they probably give us;  Society requires us to be perfect for a better future in the world, but we are simply tired of being what others want and not being able to be what we want, we are tired of being afraid of being something different from what our family expects.
            <br>  <br>
            We must know that in this situation we are not alone!  Many young people have the same thoughts and insecurities about their future, which is why we tell you about some of our solutions so that you can think and regain your confidence and peace of mind:
            <br>  <br>
            Seek professional help: It is not bad to ask for help from a professional when we do not feel well, talking to a psychologist can make us realize that the problem is not us, that we are not alone and that we can talk freely about it without it being something bad, that our future is only in our hands and that our parents may want the best for us but if it is not what we want, we are not bad.
            <br>  <br>
            Hobbies: Distract yourself for a moment, clear your mind, read a book, paint, draw, sing, dance, sew, cook;  infinities of things to do will clear our mind and we will be able to rest a bit and release stress.
            <br>  <br>
            Exercise: It helps us both in physical health and in mental health because the mind and body reach a balance that makes us feel good about ourselves.
            <br>  <br>
            Longer the road: If at the end of the day we see that what our relatives want from us is something that we also want, we can carry everything calmly to avoid stress and mental exhaustion, we could also take work and study hand in hand but little by little  It takes longer but it is a balance to be able to do other things in our lives and not focus on something so much that it can harm us
            <br>  <br>
            Contribute to society: We can already do our bit and make a difference, mark that we don't want to be the same as they expect us to be, be liberal but responsible
            <br>  <br>
            Being sociable: Making friends or having conversations with other people frees the mind and makes us enjoy the company, go out with friends or simply talk about common problems to let off steam affecting us. Also explain the barriers that we have and finally a list of possible solutions that can help us.
