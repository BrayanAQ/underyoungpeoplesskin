        <center><h2> How do we feel about it and how does it affect us? 
<br> <br>
            We have got to the part when we talk about our feelings, insecurities, worries, and mental health itself. How does this situation affect us as the young people we are, with our brain still developing and our fears starting to become real, as we are asked to perfectly know ourselves (something we are going to deepen in later), start creating our future and successfully achieve all our goals. 
            <br> <br>         
            When we get to the age when we have to start with this “adult life”, a lot of changes begin in our life. We say goodbye to that friendly environment of our high school when our parents are taking care of us and our success (in some cases), when if we mistake at some point, we can easily get up and keep going. All those things disappear, letting some others come into our lives, such as important decisions, being judged about everything we do, constantly being asked about our plans, we become also a burden on our family or a source of income, both with lots of responsibilities. 
            <br> <br>
            How could with be “all right” with all those things in our head? In fact, there are studies related with expectations and mental health that says these expectations (and when we don't achieve them) affect directly our affective reactions, and they are related with the activation of the dopamine, hormone that is involved with our movement, memory, motivation, behavior, attention, sleep, mood and learning. As we can see, if we do not get to achieve the expectations, a lof of matters in our life will be affected, and also our capability of achievement other goals because we will be too tired and moody.
            <br> <br>
            That is a huge problem because it leads us to the questions: Who am I? What am I doing? 
            If we start doing a lot of things because that's what others expect from us, getting stressed, losing sleep, not eating well, and, naturally, failing, we might start asking ourselves who we are and assuming the worst. We might start thinking that we are not worth it, that we will never success in life, that we are useless and nothing of that is true, but it is a normal behavior because we are forced to do so many things with so little time. We are asked to know what we wanna do in the exact moment and we start thinking: I have no idea, what am I gonna do? And people will start judging us for not knowing what we want, and then we realize nobody really knows themselves, we all are still learning about them, so why do they ask us to know about ourselves? We have to question everything so people cannot decide for us.</center></h2>
